# Marketing roadmap — website pages

*Last updated: June 2026. Lives in `bridge-hub` repo — see [infra-decision.md](../infra-decision.md).*

**Start at [marketing/README.md](marketing/README.md).** Visual spec: [marketing/design-system.md](marketing/design-system.md). Screening roadmap: [roadmap_screening.md](roadmap_screening.md).

---

## Overview

Warm, typography-led marketing site for women 28–45. Funnel:

```
Instagram / Podcast / Email  →  Marketing pages (this workstream)  →  /begin  →  Screening  →  Results  →  Clarity Call
```

13 marketing pages (landing, Bridge Map, About, booking embeds, etc.). Results UI and GDPR legal pages are owned by the [screening workstream](roadmap_screening.md).

---

## Environment

Marketing and screening share **one git repo** — **two Vercel projects**. No separate env file per app; use `.env.bridgehub` locally.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_URL` | This deploy's URL (`http://localhost:3000` locally) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SCREENING_URL` | Screening app URL (`http://localhost:3001` locally) — used for CTAs |

Optional later: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAL_EMBED_URL`, `KIT_API_KEY` for `/free-class`. Supabase and API keys live on the **screening** Vercel project only — see [roadmap_screening.md](roadmap_screening.md) Phase 0.

See [vercel-setup.md](../vercel-setup.md) for step-by-step Vercel configuration.

---

## Locked sitewide decisions

- **Primary CTA:** Watch the free class
- **Secondary CTA:** Discover my profile — free → `SCREENING_START` (screening deploy `/begin`)
- **No "Book your Clarity Call"** on landing or Bridge Map (results screen only)
- **Nav:** Home · About · The Bridge Map · Work with Me
- **Disclaimer everywhere:** *This is a screening tool, not a clinical diagnosis.*
- **All copy locked** after Caroline approval

- [x] `framer-motion` + `lucide-react` installed
- [x] `deep-card` token in `tailwind.config.ts`
- [x] Shared env: `.env.bridgehub` + `.env.example` (same as screening)

### Phase 1 — Scaffold — Done

- [x] `apps/marketing/` — separate Next.js app (`npm run dev:marketing` → `:3000`)

- [x] Placeholder landing (`/`) and Bridge Map (`/bridge-map`) in `apps/marketing`
- [x] Screening at repo root — `npm run dev:screening` → `:3001`
- [x] `npm run build` passes; `npm run smoke:test` 19/19

### Phase 2 — Design port + shared components (current)

- [x] Framer Motion utilities (`apps/marketing/lib/marketing/motion.ts`)
- [ ] Reusable section components (spotlight card, FAQ, carousel, synapse hero)
- [x] Landing hero + announcement + transformation vision (in progress)
- [ ] Landing remaining sections from handoff
- [ ] Bridge Map from [apps/marketing/content/bridge-map.md](../apps/marketing/content/bridge-map.md)

### Phase 3 — Core funnel pages

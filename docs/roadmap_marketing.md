# Marketing roadmap — website pages

*Last updated: June 2026. Lives in `bridge-hub` repo — see [infra-decision.md](../infra-decision.md).*

**Start at [marketing/README.md](marketing/README.md).** Visual spec: [marketing/design-system.md](marketing/design-system.md). Screening roadmap: [roadmap_screening.md](roadmap_screening.md).

---

## Overview

Warm, typography-led marketing site for women 28–45. Funnel:

```
Instagram / Podcast / Email  →  Marketing pages (this workstream)  →  /begin  →  Screening  →  Results  →  Clarity Call
```

13 marketing pages (landing, Bridge Map, About, booking embeds, etc.). Results UI and GDPR legal pages are owned by the [screening workstream](roadmap_screening.md).

---

## Environment

Marketing and screening share **one git repo** — **two Vercel projects**. No separate env file per app; use `.env.bridgehub` locally.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_URL` | This deploy's URL (`http://localhost:3000` locally) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SCREENING_URL` | Screening app URL (`http://localhost:3001` locally) — used for CTAs |

Optional later: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAL_EMBED_URL`, `KIT_API_KEY` for `/free-class`. Supabase and API keys live on the **screening** Vercel project only — see [roadmap_screening.md](roadmap_screening.md) Phase 0.

See [vercel-setup.md](../vercel-setup.md) for step-by-step Vercel configuration.

---

## Locked sitewide decisions

- **Primary CTA:** Watch the free class
- **Secondary CTA:** Discover my profile — free → `SCREENING_START` (screening deploy `/begin`)
- **No "Book your Clarity Call"** on landing or Bridge Map (results screen only)
- **Nav:** Home · About · The Bridge Map · Work with Me
- **Disclaimer everywhere:** *This is a screening tool, not a clinical diagnosis.*
- **All copy locked** after Caroline approval
